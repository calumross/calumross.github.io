              <h1>Scottish Water</h1>
              <p>I love this Scottish Water animation, it has a nice rounded, friendly look, and the 3D animation
                in a 2D style works well. It has a storyline that gives it some character, it's snappy and to the point.
                Maybe doing multiple shorter videos would be a smarter approach, since these videos are focused
                on a social media audience.</p>

              <p>This animation for Bolton Council provides all the necessary information for each
                  bin, but the narration is soul destroying, and there's not a lot of fun in the animation.
                  Informative, but not attention keeping.</p>

              <h1>Aberdeenshire Council</h1>
              <p>Done by Stuart on the course 2 years ago, this animation flows really well,
                  has a more engaging narration, and there's a lot of fun things happening around the screen
                  at all times, creating a more interesting video. Keeping that same business going on in my
                  own animation is going to be a little harder in stop motion but that's what I want to show
                  I can do.</p>

                <h1>Coca Cola</h1>
                <p>Built upon a similar premise to my project - kind of showing the process of Coca Cola's bottle
                    recycling - through a trope, a love story. I was particularly interested in how they reformed
                    the bottles to represent other objects, I plan on melting PET bottles and forming them into the
                    wildlife growing at the end of the animation.</p>

                        <p>The making of process for the Coca Cola animation, really useful for seeing
                            techniques that could be used, especially for layering animation over each
                            other and the look of the plant bottles I might use.</p>

                        <h1>Honda Paper</h1>
                        <p>This animation's really incredible, all of Honda's videos are a constant source
                            of inspiration. It took months to make though, somewhat out of my range! Using
                            real objects though and the smooth flow of this animation is what I'm aiming for.</p>

                        <h1>Walk Deformation Test</h1>
                        <p>My own video research into how the character may deform behind a bottle if it was
                          etched and shown from the other side. This video was also used for me to get a more
                          natural movement withing the character.</p>

                        <h1>Bottle Etch Test</h1>
                        <p>My first test using the Armour Etch on bottles to see how well it works, how visible
                           it appears on the brown bottles, and whether this could be a viable way to animate
                           roughly a minute of video. On reflection I feel the etching worked really well, and
                           at 8 frames per second it has a nice stop motion feel and also could be possible for me.
                           the brown bottles are completely opaque, so I could use one bottle for 2 or 3 frames,
                           and any time I want the character to go behind I could use clear, maybe green bottles?</p>

                                <p>PES's animations are always incredible, the set design is extensive, and the time
                                   taken to animate himself in stop motion shows such a huge level of skill. The wit in
                                   the choice of object replacement makes each animation beautiful and awe inspiring.</p>

                                       amazing. In the interest of time, maybe a combination of these techniques would benefit my animation?</p>
